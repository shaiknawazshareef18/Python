What I(Nawaz) have done in the project
Fuel Data Analysis & Prediction Using XGBoost
This project explores a dataset related to fuel consumption and performs data cleaning, visualization, feature engineering, and machine learning using the XGBoost algorithm.

Project Overview
The main goal of this notebook is to:
- Understand the dataset through exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Engineer features that improve model performance
- Build a predictive model using XGBoost

---

Graphical Representation (EDA)

In the first part of the notebook, I used various Python libraries like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to:
- Visualize distributions of key variables
- Analyze correlations between features
- Detect outliers and missing data
- Understand patterns in fuel consumption

Key Plots:
- Heatmaps for correlation matrix
- Boxplots to spot outliers
- Histograms for distribution insights

---

Feature Engineering

To enhance the predictive power of the dataset, I performed the following:
- Handled missing values using appropriate strategies (mean/median imputation)
- Converted categorical variables into numerical form (e.g., one-hot encoding or label encoding)

---

XGBoost Model

I used **XGBoost**, a powerful gradient boosting framework, for prediction.

Steps included:
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Initializing and training the `XGBRegressor` model
- Evaluating model performance using metrics like RMSE or R² Score
- Fine-tuning parameters (optional)
